Hello, I am an undergraduate student at the University of Maryland, double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. I have a strong passion for cybersecurity, as I am fascinated by the idea of building strong defenses against attackers.

I aspire to safeguarding individuals and organizations from malicious threats, ensuring their safety and protecting their rights. As the digital age progresses, the looming threat of malicious intent on the internet grows stronger. People need guardians now more than ever.

My academic foundation in computer science, combined with my commitment to security, positions me to contribute effectively to the goals of organizations striving to create a safer digital world.

I am currently working towards completing the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate to pursue my passion for cybersecurity and hone my skills.
